                  I created this model in order to learn the fundamentals of Autodesk Fusion 360. Because this is the first time I am using this software, I was very confused about the different functionalities present in it. I struggled to even create a rectangle because I didn't know I need to create a sketch first. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  But after figuring that out, the rest is relatively easy. For the model, I ustilised the extrude, offset and rectangular pattern functions.
                </p>

                <img src="assets\img\gallery\Mug.png">
                <p>
                  This model is relatively easy to make after I grasped all the basic functionalities. Though I did learn a new feature while making this model.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I wanted to round the corners of the handle so it won't look difficult for a hand to hold onto it, to achieve this, I used the fillet function. This rounded the handles easily.

                <p>
                  Nothing much to say about this one. It's pretty much a consolidation of what I have learnt about this software like the sketch and extrude functions
                  I also hollowed the base of the structure out for some extra offset practice.

                <p>
                  This model is a bit more difficult than the ones I've did before this. Firstly, I couldn't find a way to make an equilateral hexagon easily.
                  I tried to make one from connecting six lines together using the line tool but the resulted hexagon looks extremely irregular. It was later when I
                  checked out the video shown below where I realised that there's a function called circumscribed polygon in Fusion 360. With that, I made a equilaternal
                  hexagon effortlessly.
                </p>
                <iframe width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xho87HJ-XDo" title="How to 3D Model a Hex Nut - Learn Autodesk Fusion 360 in 30 Days: Day #6" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>
                  After extruding the shape to form a cylinder, I used the fillet function to round the corners on the top edge. Then, user the mirror function,
                  I reflected the rounded corners on the top edge to the corners located on the bottom edge of the cylinder to make them rounder as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After forming the basic structure of the hex nut, it's time to insert a circular hole in the middle of it. The usual offset-extrude combo
                  won't be useful in this case because the shape of the top edge of the hex nut is not a circle. So I had to use another function called the hole function
                  to make the hole in the middle directly.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My final step was to engrave the nut patterns on the surface of the hole I created in the step above. Thankfully, creating that was a rather easy
                  process as many of the mainstream nut patterns are included in the software. I just selected the surface I want the pattern to be engraved on and that's it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For this model, I've also applied a material on it so it can resemble a real-life hex nut more. Just like the nut patterns, there are a lot of material textures
                  that are bundled with the software. In this case, I chose the yellow copper texture because it looks gorgeous and it is also a common material
                  used to manufacture hex nuts.
                </p>

                <h2>Name Tag</h2>
                <img src="assets\img\gallery\Name Tag.png">
                <p>
                  During the making process of this model, I've learnt two new features: the combine feature and the text feature. The name tag consists of two parts, 
                  the main tag and a doughnut-shaped attachment where a thread can pass through it. I had to make the two parts as separate models. So in order to combine
                  them into one, I arranged the parts to a form I want it to be and then I used the combine function to fuse them into one model.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In order to create the extruded text part on the name tag, I had to use the text function to type in the text I want, set its position to the centre of the 
                  main tag body and set its font type and size. Then I would use the extrude function to solidify the text. That's how I modelled the word "Fablab" on the name tag.
                </p>

                <h2>Knight Chess Piece</h2>
                <img src="assets\img\gallery\Knight Chess Piece.png">
                <p>
                  This model was very fun to make! The model consists of two parts: the horse head part and the base part. For the base part, I first created a sketch
                  and using the line tool, created the outline of the shape of half the base. Then, using a new function I've learnt called the revolve function, I revolved
                  the outline 360 degrees to form a full circle, hence creating the base.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For the horse head, I googled for an image of the knight chess piece and inserted it in my Fusion 360 project. From there, I used the line tool to trace
                  the outline of the horse head in the image, and then extrude it to form a solid horse head object. After that, I change the transform of the horse head
                  to the center of the base. Finally, I made two eyes for the horse head by first inserting a sphere on one side of it and then mirror the sphere to the other
                  side of the head. Lastly, I combined all of the parts together to form a whole chess piece model.

              <br><br><div id="phone-stand">
                <h2>Phone Stand</h2>
                <img src="assets\img\gallery\Phone Stand.png">
                <p>
                  This model will be first model where I have to actually physically 3D print it out. The making process was relatively easy. I used the line tool and the extrude tool
                  to make the main body of the stand, and then used offset and extrude functions to make the hallow spaces and the support for phones. Lastly, I used the
                  fillet functions to round all the corners I feel could enhance the look of the stand by doing so. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  After finishing modelling the stand, it's time to transfer the file to the 3D printer and print it. I first exported the model as an STL file
                  and opened it in the Ultimaker Cura software to see the if the size of the printed object is to my liking and adjust it if needed. I scaled the model a bit,
                  feeling that the model was too small and export the modified model as a gcode file which the 3D printer recognises. Lastly, I transferred the gcode file to my SD card
                  and inserted it into the card slot on the 3D printer for printing. Here is the final result (With supports added to secure the phone stand during the printing process still intact):
                </p>

                <p class="image-label">3D Printed Phone Stand</p>
                <p>
                  Although I increased the size of the model, the phone stand still looks a bit small to support a modern mobile phone. Also, on hindsight, I should probably create a hole
                  or something similar on the support to allow charging wire to go through it and charge the phone while it is on the stand.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I created this music box for the final assignment of my design module. For this project, I not only had to create a box from scratch, I also had to let it actually play music.
                    In order to achieve that, I had to use something called a microcontroller to, as the name suggests, control the whole music-playing process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First off, to create a music playing system, I need to gather some components first. Obviously I need a microcontroller, but that is settled as my school distributes Arduino Uno boards
                    to each student for this assignment which also came with a bread board. Other than that, I need some dupont wires and resistors for the circuit. I also need a buzzer to generate the sounds.
                    As I want the box to play music only if a button is pressed, I need a button as well. After gathering the parts, I need to arrange the circuits. This process is extremely troublesome as I need to
                    connect all the wires, resistors and other parts between the microcontroller and the bread board correctly and I also need write some code to get my mechanism working.
                    So after some research and a lot of trail-and-error, here is the working circuit I made for playing music from the buzzer: 
                </p>

                <p class="image-label">Circuit for the Music Playing Mechanic</p>
                <p>
                    And here is the code I've written for the music playing mechanism.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    // constants won't change. They're used here to set pin numbers:
                      const int buttonPin = 3;     // the number of the pushbutton pin
                      const int ledPin =  13;      // the number of the LED pin

                      // variables will change:
                      int buttonState = 0;         // variable for reading the pushbutton status

                      int speakerPin = 9;
                      int tempo = 300;



                      int length = 35;
                      char notes[] = "eefggfedccdeedd eefggfedccdedcc"; // a space represents a rest
                      int beats[] = { 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 };

                      void playTone(int tone, int duration) {
                        for (long i = 0; i < duration * 1000L; i += tone * 2) {
                          digitalWrite(speakerPin, HIGH);
                          delayMicroseconds(tone);
                          digitalWrite(speakerPin, LOW);
                          delayMicroseconds(tone);
                        }
                      }

                      void playNote(char note, int duration) {
                        char names[] = { 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'a', 'b', 'C', 'D' };
                        int tones[] = { 1915, 1700, 1519, 1432, 1275, 1136, 1014, 956, 759 };
                        
                        // play the tone corresponding to the note name
                        for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
                          if (names[i] == note) {
                            playTone(tones[i], duration);
                          }
                        }
                      }

                      void setup() {
                        // initialize the LED pin as an output:
                        pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
                        pinMode(speakerPin, OUTPUT);
                        
                        // initialize the pushbutton pin as an input:
                        pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT);
                      }

                      void loop() {
                        // read the state of the pushbutton value:
                        buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);

                        // check if the pushbutton is pressed. If it is, the buttonState is HIGH:
                        if (buttonState == HIGH) {
                          // turn LED on:
                          digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
                          
                          for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
                            if (notes[i] == ' ') {
                              delay(beats[i] * tempo); // rest
                            } else {
                              playNote(notes[i], beats[i] * tempo);
                            }

                          // pause between notes
                            delay(tempo / 2); 
                          }
                          
                        } else {
                          // turn LED off:
                          digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
                        }
                      }
                  </pre>
                <p>
                    Using this piece of code, the buzzer, which is connected to pin 9, will play "Ode to Joy" when the button, which is connected to pin 3, is pressed.
                    In order to change the tune, the value of the char array variable "notes" has to be changed. On top of that, the values in the beats array also need to change
                    according to the length of the notes array as one value in the beats array needs to corrospond to one value in the notes array.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After that, it is time to make the box. As the music box simply needs to hold the microcontroller, bread board and all the other parts of the circuit, the structure
                    is not too complicated. I first created the main body of the box, which is basically a hollowed-out cuboid, and a cover, which is basically a shorter version of the
                    main body. In order to be aesthetically pleasing, I used the text function of Fusion 360 and engraved the text "Music Box" onto it and changed the font to "Harlow Solid Italic".
                    I chose the font because I find it suitable for the 20s and 30s retro style I'm going for. Also, at the back of the box, I made a cavity to allow the wire that connects the Arduino board
                    to a power source to pass through.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, I decided to make a cover that I can insert inside the box to conceal all the wires connected to the microcontroller to make the box look less messy.
                    I designed the cover so that it resemebles those vinyl record players in the olden days. With that, the modelling process of the box is finished.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After modelling the box, it's time to physically print it using the laser cutter. But before I could do that, there's still one more thing I need to do.
                    You might notice that the box this time does not have finger joints. Without them, it's hard to connect the printed plank together. After some googling, I found a website called
                    <a href="https://makeabox.io">makeabox.io</a>, which can generate a layout map of a box based on the dimensions you provided to it. This helps reduce a lot of time manually creating them by myself.
                    Here is an example of a map created by the website:
                </p>
                <img src="assets\img\gallery\Music Box Outline.png">
                <p class="image-label">Outline of Main Body of the Box</p>
                <p>
                    I inserted the text and the cavity myself based on their position and size on the model I've made prior. After getting the outline map, it's just a matter of printing them and
                    glueing them together. This time, I used wood glue instead of hot glue. The reason for the switch is because although hot glue is very sturdy and does not break easily, it leaves
                    a lot of marks on the box that is very hard to clean. It also occupies some space in between the planks, making the box look very dirty. But wood glue is different. It becomes transparent when dried
                    and it occupies little space compared to hot glue and it's almost as sturdy as hot glue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After that, I put the Arduino board and the vinyl board cover in place. There is still one more thing left to do. I need to find a way to attach the box cover to the main box body.
                    To do that, I decided to repurpose some hinges from an old box and attach them in-between the cover and the main body using screws. And viola! My music box is finished.
                    Here is what the box look like from the front and the back!
                </p>

                <p>
                  For this project, I also made a poster and a demo video on how to operate the music box. Here is the poster:

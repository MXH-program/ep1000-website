                <p>
                    I created this multi-layers box for one of the assignments of this module. The box consists of many parts. It contains the main body, a cover, a big drawer, two small drawers
                    and a few planks to separate different layers and compartments. On each side of the planks that's used to form the box, I added some "finger joints".
                    Finger joints are basically patterns that are present on the sides of the parts of the box so that they can be joined with each other easily.
                    This is the first major modelling project I've done and I ran into a lot of problems during the creation process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First off, although there is a reference image provided to students of how the finished box should look like, the exact dimensions are not stated and it's hard to infer from the image alone.
                    So, I had to figure out a reasonable set of dimensions on my own.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Secondly, since the box has of many parts, many of them like the drawers and separation planks have to be made separately. It's very hard to
                    create them in a way where all the different parts fit together perfectly. For example, if one of the drawers is too big, it might not fit into the hollow space
                    in the main body designated for it. When I first made the drawers, the width of both of the drawers combined is exactly the same as that of the hollow space on the main body.
                    But after thinking about it for a bit, the size of the drawers being too precise might cause the drawers to not be able to be pushed in or pulled out smoothly.
                    So after some consideration, I decided to shorten the length of both drawers by a few milimetres so as to have a bit of space left 
                    when the drawers are inserted into the main body.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, for the assignment, I need to physically create this box using materials like plywood. I didn't know how to transfer a digital model to a real world object.
                    During the lessons of the module, we were taught about a machine called "laser cutter" that is used to cut materials like plywood and acrylic into specified patterns.
                    But I was still not sure how should I tell the cutter what kind of pattern I want it to cut out. After some research, I found out that I need to create
                    a file to store all the "outlines" of the faces my box has and then transfer this file to the laser cutter so that it can cut out the wooden parts I needed.
                    As each plywood plank has a limited size, I had to split the outlines into several files, each for one major part of the box such aBs the cover, the drawers and the main body.
                    The image below is a screenshot of one of these files, this file contains the outlines for the main body:
                </p>
                <img src="assets\img\gallery\Box Outline.png">
                <p class="image-label">Outline of Main Body of the Box</p>
                <p>
                    After sending the files to the laser cutter and cut all the parts out, I stick them together using hot glue. Hot glue turned out to be not the most ideal choice for
                    sticking wood planks together. I will elaborate the reason when I talk about another project I've done that is similar to this one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After assembling the individual components of the box, I tried pushing the drawers into the space in the main body to see if they fit.
                    It turned out that leaving some space in between the main body and the drawers was a right move to make and the parts fit together perfectly.
